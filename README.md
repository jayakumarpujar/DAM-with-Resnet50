Dense Associative Memory for Image Classification with CNN (Resnet50)

This paper describes the integration of Dense Associative Memory (DAM) with Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) based Resnet50 architecture, to improve pattern recognition
capabilities. Associative memory helps to store and retrieve many more patterns than the
number of neurons in the network that helped contribute to enhanced performance in tasks
such as image classification. The proposed concept aims to address the challenges of traditional
memory systems in handling dense and complex patterns by using the feature extraction of
Resnet50. We show the results of our experiments that are more reliable than the standard
CNNs. In this problem, the network is presented with an image and the task is to label the
image. It is difficult to solve the problem if the number of patterns is more or equal to the
number of neurons in the network, or equivalently the number of pixels in an image. It can be
solved by altering the standard energy function of associative memory, quadratic interactions
between the neurons, by including in its higher-order interactions. We used the energy function
that interacts with higher-order interactions so that one can store and accurately retrieve more
patterns than the number of neurons. Our work underscores the potential of incorporating dense
associative memory into deep learning architectures, paving the way for enhancements in
pattern recognition concepts. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on innovative
strategies to improve the efficiency of neural networks for real-world applications. We
performed our experiment on the Coffee Beans dataset that is available in Kaggle.
